								My name is Vedant Prakash Shenoy. I am 21 years old. My room is in the southwest section of H6, where the football field is, and I am not married. I work as an undergrad for the Department of Physics, IIT Bombay, and I get back to my room every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
							</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								Apart from my age, affiliation and relationship status, most of the above is wrong. I quite enjoy nights out (usually with a telescope), only drink milk when there's chocolate (or coffee) involved and there's nothing more familiar to me than drama, competition and almost constant fatigue. I enjoy cooking (although I am currently limited to instant noodles, and omelettes) and enjoy even more eating. My taste in music is slightly weird even by my standards, so I shall leave that to discussions over a (virtual?) coffee. I also have a rather unhealthy appetite for comics, manga and anime (particularly those with great soundtracks).
							</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								When I am not eating, stargazing or binging on Netflix, I usually work. I write briefly about my experiences <a href="#top">here</a> (Disclaimer: I like to talk. It is long). I am an active member of <a href="https://github.com/krittikaiitb/">Krittika: The Astronomy Club of IITB</a> where I was a manager along with Kunal Deshmukh in 2019(-20). I have mentored a handful of projects as part of Krittika; a very enjoyable time which i talk about <a href="#top">here</a>.

							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								Krittika is the Astronomy Club of IIT Bombay. My journey here started in Fall 2017, when a chap named <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/gaurav-waratkar">Gaurav Waratkar</a> asked me if I knew him. I didn't. Over the next few years, I matured as a person till I realized that, maybe, bluffing my way through that question might have been a nicer thing to do. In any case, I would soon take up his post, and the great responsibility of asking freshmen if they knew who I was. While being Manager of Krittika offered a great lot of perks, a drop of 1 grade point in my SPI was also on the plate. I found it difficult to decline. 

								<br>
								Over the next few years, I took it upon myself to organize the events I had wanted so much in my freshman year. Workshops to learn Python for Astronomy, Informal stargazing sessions (this keeps coming up), Projects to learn Python for Astronomy (and so does this) and perhaps most of all, I wanted to talk (this should not come as a surprise). So I did. And then in the midst of a pandemic, the club organized a 2 week tutorial session, from scratch, on *reads script* Python for Astronomy. The new team showed a knack for publicity we never had (some have called me 'outdated'), and ushered in a new era of Krittika, marked by an abundance of active members, sophomores to us fourthies (and postdoc, thanks <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/akshat-singhal-73576010b">Akshat</a>) and Gaurav, now a PhD student (and a freshman once again). 
							</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								But more about me: I mentored 2 projects (and co-mentored a third) in the <strong>Krittika Summer Projects</strong>. One project was something on the wishlist for a while: generating synthetic analemmae for different planetary systems, and studying the dependence of shape on the eccentricity and inclination (with respect to rotation axis) of the orbit. The participants took this idea several steps forward, creating interactive plots of analemmae, and a <i>Blender</i> animation which will in the future, allow people to understand solar motion in the sky. The other project was based on Binary Systems, with participants simulating light and velocity curves for spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries, as well as fitting data to extract the parameters of the system. There was also a Blender animation in this project animating, procedurally, a possible pathway for formation of Binary Neutron Stars, as well as work done on a dataset from the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/">GROWTH-India Telescope</a> of the High Mass X-ray Binary SAX J2103.5 +4545

								<h2>Astrophotography</h2>

							<p>I try every now and then to use my DSLR to click pretty pictures. Having very little experience (see <a href="#quip_sky">here</a>) in both imaging and processing, I tend to rely on the sky quality a lot. Rare as it is, Kottayam does see some dark skies, so here are some of my favourites (aka all the good ones I have).
